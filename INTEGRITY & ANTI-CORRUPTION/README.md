# Integrity & Anti-Corruption
The fundamental idea of this course is the significance of integrity, principles, and self-identity in averting the misuse of power in both personal and professional contexts, including corruption and anti-corruption campaigns.
The importance of ethics and value systems which address issues like appreciating and managing diversity as well as interpersonal relationships was another thing I learned. 
This course also emphasizes transformation and innovation, philosophy of science and technology based on values, integrity, and self-identity, as well as holistic solutions to contemporary issues, in order to achieve the goal of producing excellent graduates in terms of physical, emotional, spiritual, and intellectual development.
