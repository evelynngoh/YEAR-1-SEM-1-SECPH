# Programming Technique I
This course taught me theory and practice in the important topic of structured approach problem solving techniques. I learned how to create C++ programs that solve simple to somewhat complicated problems. 
The topics covered in the course include pre-processor directives, constants and variables, data types, input and output statements, control structures (loop, selection, and sequential), built-in and user-defined functions, single- and two-dimensional arrays, file operations, pointers, and structured data types.
